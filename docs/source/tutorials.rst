=========

``DIRAC`` primarily includes functionalities for both horizontal and vertical integration. This tutorial consists of the following sections:

1. **Vertical Integration of DBiT-seq Data**
   - In this section, we will introduce how to perform vertical integration of DBiT-seq data using DIRAC.

2. **Horizontal Integration of DLPFC Data**
   - This section will demonstrate how to conduct horizontal integration of DLPFC data to obtain a more comprehensive perspective.

3. **Constructing the spatial domain structure of the mouse spleen (bin100) with DIRAC.**
   - In this section, we will discuss how DIRAC integrates multi-omics data to unveil the spatial and functional dynamics of immune cells in the mouse spleen.

4. **Constructing a Spatial Multi-Omics Atlas of Mouse Thymus (cellbin) with DIRAC**
   - We will explore how to utilize DIRAC to construct a spatial multi-omics atlas of immune cells in the mouse spleen to better understand their functions.
